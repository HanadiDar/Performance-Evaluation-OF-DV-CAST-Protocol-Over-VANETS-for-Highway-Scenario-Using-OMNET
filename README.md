Long range communication technologies have been used for most of non-safety applications. We focus on safety applications, in which the event-driven emergency messages,e.g., traffic accident warnings, must be efficiently disseminated within a specific geographical region . In this article We study a data dissemination protocol for vehicular networking , named Distributed Vehicular broadcast protocol (DV-CAST),to disseminate efficiently warning messages from a source to vehicles for Circular Highway Road Traffic without Obstacles with one direction during late night or early morning Hours and (Morning Rush)Rush hours with taking into account the values of MDC,ODC and DFlg parameters to build neighbor tables in DV_Cast and Dyna_DVCastLayer Scenarios for the values of Cluster Radius equals to 2450 or 250 in a range of interest(ROI) and with taking into account the studied total geographical area in Flooding Scenario on specific day using OMNET++.",author="Darwisho,Hanadi",pages="97-128",doi="10.33144/23478578/IJCST-V11I2P18",url="www.ijcstjournal.org"
